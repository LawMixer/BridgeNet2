# BridgeNet2 v0.1.0-alpha

Blazing fast networking library for Roblox.

---

## Features: Performance
 [x] **A lot faster** than Roblox's default systems. 
- [x] **Reduces Roblox's overhead per remote call: client to server takes 5 bytes, server to client takes 2 bytes.** 
- [x] Identifier system to help reduce bandwidth used on static strings; any size string will take 3 or 4 bytes. 
- [x] Utilities for optimization: FromHex, ToHex, DictionaryToTable, and more. 
- [x] Thread reusage on connections for extreme efficiency. 

## Features: Security
[] Customizable rate limiting across all bridges- never worry about remote spamming again. 
- [x] Supports middleware for easy typechecking and security implementation. 
- [x] Internally secure. It is impossible to cause an error in the library as an exploiter. 

## Features: Abstraction
- [x] Queues up remote calls to a player until they are loaded- never worry about the invocation queue again. 
- [x] Instances are abstracted away- never worry about RemoteEvents again. 
[] Abstract any optimization needed away from you- convert dictionaries to arrays and back easily. 
[] Don't worry about client/server boundaries when defining remotes. ReferenceBridge and CreateTree have you!  

## Features: API
- [x] Fully typed in strict Luau. 
- [x] Extremely performant. Never worry about API performance, ever.
- [x] Very easy to pick up. 
- [x] No more tuples- which means a much easier time using strict typing.
- [x] API is built to be extendable; you can implement your own systems and whitelists.
- [x] A new testing mode has been added; when you call BridgeNet.Testing(boolean), it will activate a mock-mode that never yields.

## Design Decisions/Explanations

There's a lot of design decisions I made with a lot of complexity behind them.

### Removing Tuples

### ReferenceIdentifier

In any library interface, you should always strive to have accurate, descriptive function names. CreateIdentifier in the original BridgeNet was almost misleading.
